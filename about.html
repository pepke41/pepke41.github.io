      <p>My name is Emily Pepke. I am an Associate Software Developer at Prudential's Customer Office.
      I work on web development. My current project has me doing work with Salesforce lightning components. 
      My real passion within that is when I get to do UI work. I like being able to do things that interact with someone.
      Within web development I have an interest in accessibility. As someone who really cares about other people making a site usable
      for all is something I stirve for.</p>
      <p>Aside from coding I enjoy playing video games, going to the gym, sppending time outside,
      and hanging out with friends.</p>
      <p>As a young developer just starting out my hopes are to become a better developer, be able to mentor others 
      especially young women, and make a difference in this industry.</p>
