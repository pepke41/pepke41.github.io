If you haven't heard of the Grace Hopper Conference Convention for Women in Computing, go check it out! I went to GHC 2015 last week, and now if you keep reading, you're going to here a little bit about my experiences.

So pre-GHC, I was _terrified_. The idea of going to a tech conference with 12000 people, some of those potential employers made me sick to my stomach. Having the imposter syndrome especially made me feel I didn't belong.

But okay fast forward to after the conference. IT WAS AMAZING.

I didn't spend as much time as I would've liked attending the talks, but the reason for that was the enormous amount of time I spent at the career fair and let me tell you I'm okay with that. I heard about companies I had never heard of, handed out probably 30 resumes and got an internship offer (Woah). Some talks I did attend were the Plenaries that included Blake Irving (GoDaddy CEO) and Sheryl Sanberg (COO of Facebook). They were really great and empowering, I have a new respect for GoDaddy, which if you know their company as it once was may surprise you. I talk to engineers from Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook. They were an amazing group of women and men that inspired me. (Thank you NCWiT for putting that together)

Coming back from Grace Hopper I have a renewed sense of excitement for what I do. I feel like maybe my imposter syndrome has even gone away (a little at least). Being around so many incredible woman and talking to so many incredible people, has given me faith in myself. If you ever get the opportunity to attend I highly recommend. I certaintly want to go again... Like every year from now on.

I know this was a little scatter brained, but I wanted to get rid of the welcome to Jekyll blog, and add my own thoughts. Although shout of for Jekyll helping me out with this sweet page. Anyway thanks for reading yinz.

Until next time, Emily.
